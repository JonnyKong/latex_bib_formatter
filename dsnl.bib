	abstract = {An adaptive video object detection system selects different execution paths at runtime, based on video content and available resources, so as to maximize accuracy under a target latency objective (e.g., 30 frames per second). Such a system is well suited to mobile devices with limited computing resources, and often running multiple contending applications. Existing solutions suffer from two major drawbacks. First, collecting feature values to decide on an execution branch is expensive. Second, there is a switching overhead for transitioning between branches and this overhead depends on the transition pair. LiteReconfig, an efficient and adaptive video object detection framework, addresses these challenges. LiteReconfig features a cost-benefit analyzer to decide which features to use, and which execution branch to run, at inference time. Furthermore, LiteReconfig has a content-aware accuracy prediction model, to select an execution branch tailored for frames in a video stream. We demonstrate that LiteReconfig achieves significantly improved accuracy under a set of varying latency objectives than existing systems, while maintaining up to 50 fps on an NVIDIA AGX Xavier board. Our code, with DOI, is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6345733.},

While the resulting algorithm- and hardware-level optimizations have enabled local execution for the majority of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices, the sheer magnitude of DNNs associated with real-time video detection workloads has forced them to remain relegated to remote execution in the cloud. This problematic when combined with the strict latency requirements that are coupled with these workloads, and imposes a unique set of challenges not directly addressed in prior works. In this work, we design MobiEye, a cloud-based video detection system optimized for deployment in real-time mobile applications. MobiEye is able to achieve up to a 32% reduction in latency when compared to a conventional implementation of video detection system with only a marginal reduction in accuracy.},

	abstract = {With smartphones' omnipresence in people's pockets, Machine Learning (ML) on mobile is gaining traction as devices become more powerful. With applications ranging from visual filters to voice assistants, intelligence on mobile comes in many forms and facets. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference remains a compute intensive workload, with devices struggling to support intelligence at the cost of responsiveness. On the one hand, there is significant research on reducing model runtime requirements and supporting deployment on embedded devices. On the other hand, the strive to maximise the accuracy of a task is supported by deeper and wider neural networks, making mobile deployment of state-of-the-art DNNs a moving target.In this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild in an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely deployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in the Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across devices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations. Simultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost dimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have developed gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and analysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and platforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep learning deployments on smartphones and indicate their popularity across app developers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and real-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning models in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Advanced video analytic systems, including scene classification and object detection, have seen widespread success in various domains such as smart cities and autonomous systems. With an evolution of heterogeneous client devices, there is incentive to move these heavy video analytics workloads from the cloud to mobile devices for low latency and real-time processing and to preserve user privacy. However, most video analytic systems are heavyweight and are trained offline with some pre-defined latency or accuracy requirements. This makes them unable to adapt at runtime in the face of three types of dynamism --- the input video characteristics change, the amount of compute resources available on the node changes due to co-located applications, and the user's latency-accuracy requirements change. In this paper we introduce ApproxDet, an adaptive video object detection framework for mobile devices to meet accuracy-latency requirements in the face of changing content and resource contention scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-branch object detection kernel, which incorporates a data-driven modeling approach on the performance metrics, and a latency SLA-driven scheduler to pick the best execution branch at runtime. We evaluate ApproxDet on a large benchmark video dataset and compare quantitatively to AdaScale and YOLOv3. We find that ApproxDet is able to adapt to a wide variety of contention and content characteristics and outshines all baselines, e.g., it achieves 52% lower latency and 11.1% higher accuracy over YOLOv3. Our software is open-sourced at https://github.com/purdue-dcsl/ApproxDet.},

In contrast to conventional MAR systems, which recognize objects using image-based computations performed in the cloud, MARVEL mainly utilizes a mobile device's local inertial sensors for recognizing and tracking multiple objects, while computing local optical flow and offloading images only when necessary. We propose a system architecture which uses local inertial tracking, local optical flow, and visual tracking in the cloud synergistically. On top of that, we investigate how to minimize the overhead for image computation and offloading. We have implemented and deployed a holistic prototype system in a commercial building and evaluate MARVEL's performance. The efficient use of a mobile device's capabilities lowers latency and energy consumption without sacrificing accuracy.},

	abstract = {Human pose estimation is a key technique for many vision-based mobile applications. Yet existing multi-person pose-estimation methods fail to achieve a satisfactory user experience on commodity mobile devices such as smartphones, due to their long model-inference latency. In this paper, we propose MobiPose, a system designed to enable real-time multi-person pose estimation on mobile devices through three novel techniques. First, MobiPose takes a motion-vector-based approach to fast locate the human proposals across consecutive frames by fine-grained tracking of joints of human body, rather than running the expensive human-detection model for every frame. Second, MobiPose designs a mobile-friendly model that uses lightweight multi-stage feature extractions to significantly reduce the latency of pose estimation without compromising the model accuracy. Third, MobiPose leverages the heterogeneous computing resources of both CPU and GPU to execute the pose estimation model for multiple persons in parallel, which further reduces the total latency. We have implemented the MobiPose system on off-the-shelf commercial smartphones and conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Evaluation results show that MobiPose achieves over 20 frames per second pose estimation with 3 persons per frame, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, with a speedup of up to 4.5X and 2.8X in latency on CPU and GPU, respectively, and an improvement of 5.1% in pose-estimation model accuracy. Furthermore, MobiPose achieves up to 62.5% and 37.9% energy-per-frame saving on average in comparison with the baseline on mobile CPU and GPU, respectively.},

	abstract = {The demand for mobile video streaming has experienced tremendous growth over the last decade. However, existing methods of video delivery fall short of delivering high-quality video. Recent advances in neural super-resolution have opened up the possibility of enhancing video quality by leveraging client-side computation. Unfortunately, mobile devices cannot benefit from this because it is too expensive in computation and power-hungry.To overcome the limitation, we present NEMO, a system that enables real-time video super-resolution on mobile devices. NEMO applies neural super-resolution to a few select frames and transfers the outputs to benefit the remaining frames. The frames to which super-resolution is applied are carefully chosen to maximize the overall quality gains. NEMO leverages fine-grained dependencies using information from the video codec and strives to provide guarantees in the quality degradation compared to per-frame super-resolution. Our evaluation using a full system implementation on Android shows NEMO improves the overall processing throughput by x11.5, reduces energy consumption by 88.6\%, and maintains device temperatures at acceptable levels compared to per-frame super-resolution, while ensuring high video quality. Overall, this leads to a 31.2\% improvement in quality of experience for mobile users.},

Moreover, the computation can be redundant since neighboring frames are inherently similar to each other. In this work we propose to improve video object detection via temporal aggregation. Specifically, a detection model is applied on sparse keyframes to handle new objects, occlusions, and rapid motions. We then use real-time trackers to exploit temporal cues and track the detected objects in the remaining frames, which enhances efficiency and temporal coherence. Object status at the bounding-box level is propagated across frames and updated by our aggregation modules. For keyframe scheduling, we propose adaptive policies using reinforcement learning and simple heuristics. The proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset while running real-time on CPU. Extensive experiments are done to show the effectiveness of our training strategies and justify the model designs.},

	abstract = {With the recent trend of on-device deep learning, inference latency has become a crucial  
metric in running Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on various mobile and edge devices.  
To this end, latency prediction of DNN model inference is highly desirable for many  
tasks where measuring the latency on real devices is infeasible or too costly, such  
as searching for efficient DNN models with latency constraints from a huge model-design  
space. Yet it is very challenging and existing approaches fail to achieve a high accuracy  
of prediction, due to the varying model-inference latency caused by the runtime optimizations  
on diverse edge devices.In this paper, we propose and develop nn-Meter, a novel and  
efficient system to accurately predict the inference latency of DNN models on diverse  
edge devices. The key idea of nn-Meter is dividing a whole model inference into kernels,  
i.e., the execution units on a device, and conducting kernel-level prediction. nn-Meter  
builds atop two key techniques: (i) kernel detection to automatically detect the execution  
unit of model inference via a set of well-designed test cases; and (ii) adaptive sampling  
to efficiently sample the most beneficial configurations from a large space to build  
accurate kernel-level latency predictors. Implemented on three popular platforms of  
edge hardware (mobile CPU, mobile GPU, and Intel VPU) and evaluated using a large  
dataset of 26,000 models, nn-Meter significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art.},

While Neural Networks (NNs)-based object detection models have shown excellent accuracy  
on benchmark datasets, they are not well positioned for high-resolution images inference  
on resource-constrained edge devices. Common approaches, including down-sampling inputs  
and scaling up neural networks, fall short of adapting to video content changes and  
various latency requirements. This paper presents Remix, a flexible framework for  
high-resolution object detection on edge devices. Remix takes as input a latency budget,  
and come up with an image partition and model execution plan which runs off-the-shelf  
neural networks on non-uniformly partitioned image blocks. As a result, it maximizes  
the overall detection accuracy by allocating various amount of compute power onto  
different areas of an image. We evaluate Remix on public dataset as well as real-world  
videos collected by ourselves. Experimental results show that Remix can either improve  
the detection accuracy by 18%-120% for a given latency budget, or achieve up to 8.1\texttimes{}  
inference speedup with accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art NNs.},

In this paper, we present PRETZEL, a prediction serving system introducing a novel white box architecture enabling both end-to-end and multi-model optimizations. Using production-like model pipelines, our experiments show that PRETZEL is able to introduce performance improvements over different dimensions; compared to state-of-the-art approaches PRETZEL is on average able to reduce 99th percentile latency by 5.5\texttimes{} while reducing memory footprint by 25\texttimes{}, and increasing throughput by 4.7\texttimes{}.},

Existing model serving architectures use well-known reactive techniques to alleviate common-case sources of latency, but cannot effectively curtail tail latency caused by unpredictable execution times. Yet the underlying execution times are not fundamentally unpredictable--on the contrary we observe that inference using Deep Neural Network (DNN) models has deterministic performance.Here, starting with the predictable execution times of individual DNN inferences, we adopt a principled design methodology to successively build a fully distributed model serving system that achieves predictable end-to-end performance. We evaluate our implementation, Clockwork, using production trace workloads, and show that Clockwork can support thousands of models while simultaneously meeting 100 ms latency targets for 99.9999\% of requests. We further demonstrate that Clockwork exploits predictable execution times to achieve tight request-level service-level objectives (SLOs) as well as a high degree of request-level performance isolation.},

Today, there is an unmet need in providing such analytics in an interactive manner, especially over weak Internet connections, to quickly diagnose and solve problems in the commercial industry space of monitoring assets using drones in remote parts of the world. Existing mechanisms either compromise on the quality of insights by not building 3D images and analyze individual 2D images in isolation, or spend tens of minutes building a 3D image before obtaining and uploading insights. We present Visage, a system that accelerates 3D image analytics by identifying smaller parts of the data that can actually benefit from 3D analytics and prioritizing building, and uploading the localized 3D images for those parts. To achieve this, Visage uses a graph to represent raw 2D images and their relative content overlap, and then identifies the various subgraphs using application knowledge that are good candidates for localized 3D image based insights. We evaluate Visage using data from multiple real deployments and show that it can reduce analytics-latency by up to four orders of magnitude.},

This paper introduces Ribbon, a novel deep learning inference serving system that meets two competing objectives: quality-of-service (QoS) target and cost-effectiveness. The key idea behind Ribbon is to intelligently employ a diverse set of cloud computing instances (heterogeneous instances) to meet the QoS target and maximize cost savings. Ribbon devises a Bayesian Optimization-driven strategy that helps users build the optimal set of heterogeneous instances for their model inference service needs on cloud computing platforms - and, Ribbon demonstrates its superiority over existing approaches of inference serving systems using homogeneous instance pools. Ribbon saves up to 16\% of the inference service cost for different learning models including emerging deep learning recommender system models and drug-discovery enabling models.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of Jaguar, a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) system that features accurate, low-latency, and large-scale object recognition and flexible, robust, and context-aware tracking. Jaguar pushes the limit of mobile AR's end-to-end latency by leveraging hardware acceleration with GPUs on edge cloud. Another distinctive aspect of Jaguar is that it seamlessly integrates marker-less object tracking offered by the recently released AR development tools (e.g., ARCore and ARKit) into its design. Indeed, some approaches used in Jaguar have been studied before in a standalone manner, e.g., it is known that cloud offloading can significantly decrease the computational latency of AR. However, the question of whether the combination of marker-less tracking, cloud offloading and GPU acceleration would satisfy the desired end-to-end latency of mobile AR (i.e., the interval of camera frames) has not been eloquently addressed yet. We demonstrate via a prototype implementation of our proposed holistic solution that Jaguar reduces the end-to-end latency to ~33 ms. It also achieves accurate six degrees of freedom tracking and 97\% recognition accuracy for a dataset with 10,000 images.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been increasingly adopted by a wide range of time-critical applications running on edge platforms with heterogeneous multiprocessors. To meet the stringent timing requirements of these applications, heterogeneous CPU and GPU resources must be efficiently utilized for the inference of multiple DNN models. Such a cross-processor real-time DNN inference paradigm poses major challenges due to the inherent performance imbalance among different processors and the lack of real-time support for cross-processor inference from existing deep learning frameworks. In this work, we propose a new system named BlastNet that exploits duo-block - a new model inference abstraction to support highly efficient cross-processor real-time DNN inference. Each duo-block has a dual model structure, enabling efficient fine-grained inference alternatively across different processors. BlastNet employs a novel block-level Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique to generate duo-blocks, which accounts for computing characteristics and communication overhead. The duo-blocks are optimized at design time and then dynamically scheduled to achieve high resource utilization of heterogeneous CPU and GPU at runtime. BlastNet is implemented on an indoor autonomous driving platform and three popular edge platforms. Extensive results show that BlastNet achieves 35.07 \% less deadline missing rate with a mere 1.63\% of model accuracy loss.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models are becoming the primary work-horses for many applications. Services deploy models through prediction serving systems that take in queries and return predictions by performing inference on models. Prediction serving systems are commonly run on many machines in cluster settings, and thus are prone to slowdowns and failures that inflate tail latency. Erasure coding is a popular technique for achieving resource-efficient resilience to data unavailability in storage and communication systems. However, existing approaches for imparting erasure-coded resilience to distributed computation apply only to a severely limited class of functions, precluding their use for many serving workloads, such as neural network inference.We introduce parity models, a new approach for enabling erasure-coded resilience in prediction serving systems. A parity model is a neural network trained to transform erasure-coded queries into a form that enables a decoder to reconstruct slow or failed predictions. We implement parity models in ParM, a prediction serving system that makes use of erasure-coded resilience. ParM encodes multiple queries into a "parity query," performs inference over parity queries using parity models, and decodes approximations of unavailable predictions by using the output of a parity model. We showcase the applicability of parity models to image classification, speech recognition, and object localization tasks. Using parity models, ParM reduces the gap between 99.9th percentile and median latency by up to 3.5X, while maintaining the same median. These results display the potential of parity models to unlock a new avenue to imparting resource-efficient resilience to prediction serving systems.},

registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images
to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is taster
because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques
Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling
and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision
system.},

	abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008–2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community’s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes HeteroG, an automatic module to accelerate deep neural network training in heterogeneous GPU clusters. To train a deep learning model with large amounts of data, distributed training using data or model parallelism has been widely adopted, mostly over homogeneous devices (GPUs, network bandwidth). Heterogeneous training environments may often exist in shared clusters with GPUs of different models purchased in different batches and network connections of different bandwidth availability (e.g., due to contention). Classic data parallelism does not work well in a heterogeneous cluster, while model-parallel training is hard to plan. HeteroG enables highly-efficient distributed training over heterogeneous devices, by automatically converting a single-GPU training model to a distributed one according to the deep learning graph and available resources. HeteroG embraces operation-level hybrid parallelism, communication architecture selection and execution scheduling, based on a carefully designed strategy framework exploiting both GNN-based learning and combinatorial optimization. We compare HeteroG with existing parallelism schemes and show that it achieves up-to 222\% training speed-up. HeteroG also enables efficient training of large models over a set of heterogeneous devices where simple parallelism is infeasible.},

  abstractnote = {Modern deep learning systems like PyTorch and Tensorflow are able to train enormous models with billions (or trillions) of parameters on a distributed infrastructure. These systems require that the internal nodes have the same memory capacity and compute performance. Unfortunately, most organizations, especially universities, have a piecemeal approach to purchasing computer systems resulting in a heterogeneous infrastructure, which cannot be used to compute large models. The present work describes HetSeq, a software package adapted from the popular PyTorch package that provides the capability to train large neural network models on heterogeneous infrastructure. Experiments with language translation, text and image classification shows that HetSeq scales over heterogeneous systems.
